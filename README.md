# trbot
A spread beating crypto trading bot. Built using the binance API.

The bots on Binance always one-up your limit order whether itâ€™s a sell or a buy order making it really difficult to buy any crypto asset at the market rate using a limit order. But submitting a market order on Binance is risky because the moment you do that, the bots on Binance drop their buy/sell walls and you end up eating the upper end of the order book. TRBOT was a fun little bot I built to beat the other bots on Binance. It uses the Binance SDK, JavaFX for some simple UI and plain old Java concurrency.
